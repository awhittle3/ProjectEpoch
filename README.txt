PROJECT EPOCH

The goal of this project is to develop an Unity game within a day.

This is a game where the user can throw balls of energy at a target, in a manner
inspired by the Spirit Bomb from the series Dragonball Z.

You can rotate with the right and left arrow keys.  Click and hold the mouse to
charge up the bomb, and release to throw it.  See how many times you can hit the
enemy!

Hit the escape key to quit.
